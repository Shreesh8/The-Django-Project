<h3>Reminder</h3>
Nearly 99% of the things you see here is Work in Progress. <br>
This is not a <b>finished project!</b>
<hr>

<h3>NOTE:</h3>
I was creating a new Repository because my commit history was ruined, and for some reason it didnt clone the issues.
So if you want to look at the old issues you have to look at the old repo (its private, you have to ask me).
